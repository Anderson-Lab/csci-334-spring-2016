## Grading Policy
Exams - 60%<br>
Homework - 10%<br>
Programming Projects - 20%<br>
Final Project and Presentation - 10%

## Grading Scale
A: 90-100; B: 80-89; C: 70-79; D: 65-69; F: <65. Plusses and minuses will be used at the
discretion of the instructor.

### Grading Guidelines
Submitted work requires Analysis, Evaluation, and Creation of ideas, concepts, and
materials into various deliverables (e.g., see revised Bloom's Taxonomy
(http://www.nwlink.com/~donclark/hrd/bloom.html) and reference below).

The grade of A is for work that involves high-quality achievement in all three Bloom areas.<br>
The grade of B is for work that involves high-quality achievement in at least two Bloom areas, and mediumlevel
achievement in the other.<br>
The grade of C is for work that involves high-quality achievement in at least one Bloom area, and mediumlevel
achievement in the others.<br>
The grade of F is for work that does not meet above criteria.

Inc., Darlinghurst, Australia, Australia, 155-161.

### Exam Policy
Student performance will be accessed through weekly exams. Each exam will cover the material from the previous week. They will last no more than 15 minutes. No makeup exams will be allowed. Your lowest exam grade will be dropped.

### Homework Policy
Homework will be assigned each week and collected each Thursday before the weekly exam. Homework will be graded pass or fail and are designed to help you study for the exams. For the majority of the classes, the worksheets will double as assigned homework for you to turn in before the following exam.

### Programming Projects
Programming projects will be submitted through the Learn2Mine environment. You may use either Python or R to complete the assignments. Usernames and passwords will be supplied, but you may install your own software as well on your local computer.

### Honor Code
You must do your work alone (or with your teammates, for group assignments).<br>
You must identify your sources of material and inspiration. It is a violation of the honor code to present
someone else's work or ideas as your own.<br>
In any course deliverable, you must always identify the person(s) that helped you (directly or indirectly), if
any, and explain their contribution to your work.<br>
Also see the College of Charleston Student Handbook, especially sections on The Honor Code (p. 11), and
Student Code of Conduct (p. 12). There is other useful information there.

### Classroom Policies
* Tuesday will be devoted to introducing new material. It has been shown in numerous studies that even having a laptop open during this type of instruction negatively affects not only your learning but those around you. Because of this, we will have a strict no
laptop policy open on the desk on Tuesday. I will do my best to record all lectures and post them in a timely fashion.<br>
* You are expected to take good notes during class.
* You are expected to participate in class with questions and invited discussion.
* You are expected to attend all classes. The grade 'WA' will be given for excessive (>= 3) absences. If you
miss class, you must get an absence memo from the Associate Dean of Students Office
(http://studentaffairs.cofc.edu/general_info/absence/) ; also, you are responsible for announcements made in
class, assignment due dates, etc.
* In summary, you should contribute positively to the classroom learning experience, and respect your
classmates right to learn (see College of Charleston Student Handbook (http://studentaffairs.cofc.edu/honorsystem/
studenthandbook/index.php) , section on Classroom Code of Conduct (p. 58)).

### Late Policy
No late days will be allowed without an excuse. This course is an upper level course, and it will move very fast.
Falling behind on assignments will make it difficult to achieve the learning outcomes of this course.

### Final Exam
April 28th from 8 - 11 AM. This time will be used for final project presentations.

## Facebook Group
Everyone must join the Facebook group for class discussions: 
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1534410590185173/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/1534410590185173/</a>

# Schedule
You are responsible for coming prepared to class. This includes reading through the material before attending class.
You will get a lot more out of the lectures and discussions in this manner. It is cliche, but true. Each week will follow a similar pattern. On Tuesday new material will be introduced and discussed. Thursday will start with an exam over the previous week's material. Followed by an interactive exercise. This will sometimes be guided. sometimes in groups, and sometimes individually. The schedule below is tentative and subject to change. You must check it regularly.

The Anderson Data Science Research Lab applies and develops algorithms in data mining, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to the fields of big data, knowledge discovery, bioinformatics, genomics, and metabolomics. We develop algorithms and software to tackle some of the most challenging and interesting data intensive problems in the life sciences. Our research interests include data science, big data, pattern analysis in high-dimensionality data sets, evolutionary computation and optimization, machine learning, computational genomics, cloud computing, computational metabolomics, and eScience. We currently have multidisciplinary projects underway in metabolomics, human cognition, toxicology, marine biology, medical genomics, biomedical informatics, and marine genomics.
