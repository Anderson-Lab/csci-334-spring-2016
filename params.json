Recognize that data mining is part of a larger process and be able to describe the various stages of that\r\nprocess.\r\n3. Understand the need for and techniques for carrying out data cleaning and other data pre-processing\r\nactivities and to apply them to real-world data sets.\r\n4. Understand and apply a wide range of the fundamental classification and prediction algorithms, including\r\nalgorithms for decision trees and rule-based classifiers, Bayes classification methods, and other classification\r\napproaches such as logistic regression, k-nearest neighbor, and neural networks.\r\n5. Examine and apply metrics for classifier performance and selection.\r\n6. Examine and apply metrics for association pattern evaluation.\r\n7. Understand and apply several clustering algorithms including k-means clustering and BIRCH clustering.\r\n8. Examine and apply metrics for cluster evaluation such as clustering tendency, number of clusters, and\r\nclustering quality.\r\n9. Examine and apply metrics for attribute selection.\r\n10. Recognize some of the current data mining trends and research frontiers.\r\n11. Explore the use of data mining techniques on different datasets using software packages.\r\n\r\n## Grading Policy\r\nExams - 60%<br>\r\nHomework - 10%<br>\r\nProgramming Projects - 20%<br>\r\nFinal Project and Presentation - 10%\r\n\r\n## Grading Scale\r\nA: 90-100; B: 80-89; C: 70-79; D: 65-69; F: <65. Plusses and minuses will be used at the\r\ndiscretion of the instructor.\r\n\r\n### Grading Guidelines\r\nSubmitted work requires Analysis, Evaluation, and Creation of ideas, concepts, and\r\nmaterials into various deliverables (e.g., see revised Bloom's Taxonomy\r\n(http://www.nwlink.com/~donclark/hrd/bloom.html) and reference below).\r\n\r\nThe grade of A is for work that involves high-quality achievement in all three Bloom areas.<br>\r\nThe grade of B is for work that involves high-quality achievement in at least two Bloom areas, and mediumlevel\r\nachievement in the other.<br>\r\nThe grade of C is for work that involves high-quality achievement in at least one Bloom area, and mediumlevel\r\nachievement in the others.<br>\r\nThe grade of F is for work that does not meet above criteria.\r\n\r\nReference: Errol Thompson, Andrew Luxton-Reilly, Jacqueline L. Whalley, Minjie Hu, and Phil Robbins. 2008.\r\nBloom's taxonomy for CS assessment. In Proceedings of the tenth conference on Australasian computing education\r\n- Volume 78 (ACE '08), Simon Hamilton and Margaret Hamilton (Eds.), Vol. 78. Australian Computer Society,\r\nInc., Darlinghurst, Australia, Australia, 155-161.\r\n\r\n### Exam Policy\r\nStudent performance will be accessed through weekly exams. Each exam will cover the material from the previous week. They will last no more than 15 minutes. No makeup exams will be allowed. Your lowest exam grade will be dropped.\r\n\r\n### Homework Policy\r\nHomework will be assigned each week and collected each Thursday before the weekly exam. Homework will be graded pass or fail and are designed to help you study for the exams.\r\n\r\n### Programming Projects\r\nProgramming projects will be submitted through the Learn2Mine environment. You may use either Python or R to complete the assignments. Usernames and passwords will be supplied, but you may install your own software as well on your local computer.\r\n\r\n### Honor Code\r\nYou must do your work alone (or with your teammates, for group assignments).<br>\r\nYou must identify your sources of material and inspiration. It is a violation of the honor code to present\r\nsomeone else's work or ideas as your own.<br>\r\nIn any course deliverable, you must always identify the person(s) that helped you (directly or indirectly), if\r\nany, and explain their contribution to your work.<br>\r\nAlso see the College of Charleston Student Handbook, especially sections on The Honor Code (p. 11), and\r\nStudent Code of Conduct (p. 12). There is other useful information there.\r\n\r\n### Classroom Policies\r\nTuesday will be devoted to introducing new material. It has been shown in numerous studies that even having a laptop open during this type of instruction negatively affects not only your learning but those around you. Because of this, we will have a strict no\r\nlaptop policy open on the desk on Tuesday. I will do my best to record all lectures and post them in a timely fashion.<br>\r\nYou are expected to take good notes during class.<br>\r\nYou are expected to participate in class with questions and invited discussion.<br>\r\nYou are expected to attend all classes. The grade 'WA' will be given for excessive (>= 3) absences. If you\r\nmiss class, you must get an absence memo from the Associate Dean of Students Office\r\n(http://studentaffairs.cofc.edu/general_info/absence/) ; also, you are responsible for announcements made in\r\nclass, assignment due dates, etc.<br>\r\nIn summary, you should contribute positively to the classroom learning experience, and respect your\r\nclassmates right to learn (see College of Charleston Student Handbook (http://studentaffairs.cofc.edu/honorsystem/\r\nstudenthandbook/index.php) , section on Classroom Code of Conduct (p. 58)).\r\n\r\n### Late Policy\r\nNo late days will be allowed without an excuse. This course is an upper level course, and it will move very fast.\r\nFalling behind on assignments will make it difficult to achieve the learning outcomes of this course.\r\n\r\n### Final Exam\r\nApril 28th from 8 - 11 AM. This time will be used for final project presentations.\r\n\r\n# Schedule\r\nYou are responsible for coming prepared to class. This includes reading through the material before attending class.\r\nYou will get a lot more out of the lectures and discussions in this manner. It is cliche, but true. Each week will follow a similar pattern. On Tuesday new material will be introduced and discussed. Thursday will start with an exam over the previous week's material. Followed by an interactive exercise. This will sometimes be guided. sometimes in groups, and sometimes individually.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
